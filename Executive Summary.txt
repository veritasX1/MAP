Executive Summary

The Mesh Anonymity Protocol (MAP) is a fully decentralized, identity-free, and ephemeral network protocol that works without servers, fixed infrastructure, or permanently linkable identifiers. MAP uses only the physical radio transport means currently available to a device (e.g., Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi Aware, Bluetooth Low Energy) and forms a spontaneous, fluctuating mesh network whose existence is determined solely by the devices currently present.

MAP does not transmit any metadata that could be used to identify devices, users, or their relationships. Instead, the protocol is based on anonymous presence signals and a strictly content-oriented architecture: content is broken down into small, uniformly structured chunks and distributed across the mesh without revealing its origin or history. The network itself does not store anything; only devices can save content locally. This locally stored content can be carried to any other mesh context via the Portable Content Layer (PCL) and reintroduced there anonymously.

MAP provides the Ephemeral Identity Layer (EIL) for optional messenger or interaction functions. It generates temporary pseudo-identifiers (EUI) that can be revoked at any time and are only valid within a current mesh context. Linking across time, space, or different meshes is not possible. Use of this identity system is entirely voluntary.

MAP thus creates a network model that is characterized by the following features:
- Absolute decentralization: no server, no backbone, no routing tables.
- Maximum anonymity: no reusable identities, no metadata.
- Ephemerality: meshes only exist in the moment of presence.
- Content orientation: content is the only stable unit—not the devices.
- Transport agnosticism: MAP works over any available short-range radio technology.
- Censorship and surveillance resistance: no node information, no hierarchy, no control points.

MAP thus enables a new class of local networks: spontaneous, anonymous, resilient, and driven exclusively by their users.
